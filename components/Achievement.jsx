            The CPC would later merge with other legacy parties to forming the
            All Progressives Congress (APC). Saliu, dogged, dutiful and
            conscientious, was among the very few that made the historic merger
            come to reality. Since then till now, he has remained true to the
            progressive ideology as a stakeholder of the APC both at his home
            state and at the national level. He has contributed in no small
            measure to the sustenance of the party at all levels.
            <br />

            Through his foundation – the Saliu Mustapha Foundation – Saliu has
            engaged in a wide range of charitable projects in his hometown and
            beyond, advancing humanitarian causes.
