                As an undergraduate, Saliu Mustapha developed keen interest in
                governance and that formed the basis of his evolution into
                politics. His belief in purposeful and progressive leadership
                vis-a-vis dedication to public service, brought him on the same
                ideological paths with the likes of Chief Alexis Aniello, Chief
                Olu Falae, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, and President Muhammadu Buhari.

                Publicity Secretary of the Progressive Liberation Party (PLP)
                under the leadership of Dr. Ezekiel Ezeogwu. A little further in
                2003, Saliu and other likeminds came together to register and
                form the Progressive Action Congress (PAC), whereat he was
                returned again as a National Publicity Secretary, an impressive
                feat for his age and clout as at that time.
