                  <p>
                    As an undergraduate, Saliu Mustapha developed keen interest
                    in governance and that formed the basis of his evolution
                    into politics. His belief in purposeful and progressive
                    leadership vis-a-vis dedication to public service, brought
                    him on the same ideological paths with the likes of Chief
                    Alexis Aniello, Chief Olu Falae, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, and
                    President Muhammadu Buhari.

                  <p>
                    Specifically, between 2001 â€“ 2002, Saliu was the National
                    Publicity Secretary of the Progressive Liberation Party
                    (PLP) under the leadership of Dr. Ezekiel Ezeogwu. A little
                    further in 2003, Saliu and other likeminds came together to
                    register and form the Progressive Action Congress (PAC),
                    whereat he was returned again as a National Publicity
                    Secretary, an impressive feat for his age and clout as at
                    that time.

              At about the time President Muhammadu Buhari conceived the idea of
              coming back into public service as a civilian President, Saliu
              Mustapha keyed into the vision. Thus, he became a pivotal member
              of The Buhari Organisation (TBO) and the Buhari Campaign
              Organisation (BCO) respectively for several years.

              decided to go into the political trenches to hold forth for the
              ANPP in his home state, Kwara State, where he contested as a
              member of the Federal House of Representatives for Ilorin East and
              South Federal Constituency.
